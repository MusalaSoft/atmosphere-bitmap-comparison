## Project setup

### Build the project
You can build the project using the included gradle wrapper by running:
* `./gradlew build` on Linux/macOS<br/>
* `gradlew build` on Windows.

### Publish to Maven Local
If the build is successful, also run:
* `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal` (Linux/macOS)
* `gradlew publishToMavenLocal` (Windows)

to publish the jar to the local Maven repository so other projects that depend on it can use it.
